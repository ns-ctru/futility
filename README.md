# Futility - Conditional power calculations for stopping RCTs

This repository contains the R package ''futility'' which allows the conditional power of an in-progress Randomised Control Trial (RCT) to be calculated with a view to stopping the trial earlier because of futility (i.e. any further data collected will not alter the conclusions drawn from it).
