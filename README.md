# Futility - Conditional power calculations for stopping RCTs

This repository contains the R package `futility` which allows the conditional power of an in-progress Randomised Control Trial (RCT) to be calculated with a view to stopping the trial earlier because of futility (i.e. any further data collected will not alter the conclusions drawn from it).  It reports the probability of stopping a study for futility as well as the probability of continuing and finding a non-signicant result.

## Functionality

## Installation

    install.packages(devtools)
	library(devtools)
